# Gradual Room Migration

Sample code for my [article](https://goo.gl/Abv7Pq) about how to gradually migrate a huge SQLite database with many
tables using outdated ORM libraries to [Room Persistence](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room)
 library without the need to migrate all the tables at once and still release updates to your app in the process.
